        <h2>The Story According to Carrie</h2>

        <p style="overflow:auto"><i class="uk-icon-quote-left"></i> Todd and I met at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, where we both worked in the Inpatient Pharmacy.  He started 2 months after me and it was my job to train him on the evening shift.  We started talking and the more I learned about him, the more I liked him.  After a particularly rough day I asked him on a whim if he wanted to get blueberry pancakes with me after work.  He said "sure" and I was elated!
        </p>
        <p>
          It took some prodding to make him realize my romantic intentions, but his cluelessness was cute, haha.  I knew that if I didn't pursue him, someone else would.  He's a great guy, and a rare gem!  I couldn't let him pass me by.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks later, I had Thanksgiving dinner with his family, and I just knew, after slow-dancing in the kitchen while we cooked, that he was my person.  We both admitted to each other that evening that we loved each other.
        </p>
        <p>
        Falling in love with Todd was the most natural thing in the world.  They say, "When you know, you know."  And it was that easy!  We hadn't known each other very long, but I already knew that he had changed my life for the better and that I couldn't imagine my life without him.  I love you Todd, you are the love of my life!! <i class="uk-icon-heart"></i> <i class="uk-icon-heart"></i> <i class="uk-icon-heart"></i>  Thank you for renewing my faith, and showing me the best life has to offer. <i class="uk-icon-quote-right"></i></p>

          I met Carrie in the break room of Dartmouth Hitchcock when I was introduced to her.  She was going to train me on the Robot the following week, and she just lit up and said that we were going to have fun.  That was the first time I saw her smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will admit that during the initial courtship I wasn't the most observant of people.  When she came back to where we were working and asked if I wanted to play tic-tac-toe, we played a game and then I told her about how if played correctly, it wasn't possible to win that game.  What I didn't realize was she was trying to win me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further clueless Todd moments happened before we finally had our first date at The Fort in Lebanon, NH.  It was after work and I had the Alamo omelette.  I remember because I didn't finish half of it because we were talking for hours.  We were the only ones there at after midnight other than the server who chimed in "Enjoy it while it lasts."  We are enjoying ourselves to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 6 months after we started dating we went on a vacation to York, Maine for a long weekend.  We both knew at some point I would ask her to marry me, but I wasn't saying when.  I waited until the end of the weekend, right before our last dinner when we were getting dressed up.  She asked me how she looked, I told her to spin around.  I said she was beautiful, but missing one accessory, and dropped to my knee to propose. I love you Carrie, and I can't wait to have the honor of being your husband. <i class="uk-icon-quote-right"></i>
